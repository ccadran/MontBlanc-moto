# MontBlanc-moto

I integrated a model that I found on Dribble to train my skills, this model was created by Dmitry Kiiashko and the moto design by Huigyu Kim.


The responsive version was not coherent so i try to do an html fil for each version (web, mobile and tablet) and load it with a Js script who can detect the width of the navigator but that was to much difficulty for me and this not a clean way to make the responsive of a project so I restart it from the mobile version and you can now see it on the 'MontBlanc-moto-V2 repository.
